## Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO)
- Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) has been considered as useful exploration procedure for some time (Ostrander, 1984; Chacko, 1989; Rutherford and
Williams, 1989; Burnett, 1990).

- The main goal of AVO analysis is to estimate the **Poisson's ratio (Vp/Vs)** in subsurface zone using conventional surface seismic data.

- Poisson's ration is important to explorationists because it be diagnostic of both **gas satuation and gross lithology** (Tatham and Krug, 1985).
